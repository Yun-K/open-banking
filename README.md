# Open Banking app

This app is aimed at users who have multiple bank cards, which allows the user to manage different bank accounts from different bank institutions. The goal is to allow the user to easily add and manage all cards from different banks. Services include card management, making payments and transactions, usersâ€™ financial information management, GPS to find nearest corresponding banks, etc.

> NOTE: it is worth to mention that due to the lack of maintaince on firebase settings, and the lack of the testing, this app most like cannot work properly as expect. Hence, it is just a project to practise in order to accumulate the skills.
